## Why

I created AllPercs because I found myself frequently needing to calculate various percentages of numbers, and I wanted a tool that would show all common percentages at once. While there are many percentage calculators available, none provided the quick overview I was looking for. This tool fills that gap by instantly showing all percentages from 1% to 100% of any given number.
